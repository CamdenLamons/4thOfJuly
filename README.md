# 4thOfJuly

Introduction:
This is just a fun project I did for the 4th of July. Its just a simple animation using keyframes. I used keyframes because I want to learn more about them. Also so I know when I should use keyframes and when not to. If you want to add to this project go right a head. Just read table of contents before you start working.

Table of Contents:
1. Please follow the rules.
2. Every one is welcome.
3. Write comments when you code.
4. Tell people what you did when upload code to github.
